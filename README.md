## Components üß©

The following components are registered on the 'mORMot2 Crypto' palette in the Delphi IDE:

### `TmORMotAES` üîë
Provides AES symmetric encryption and decryption capabilities. This component allows you to encrypt and decrypt text or raw byte data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. You can choose from various AES modes and key sizes.

It's suitable for data integrity checks and password storage (when combined with salting and key derivation functions). You can hash strings, raw byte data, files, or streams and verify if an input matches a given hash. The output format of the hash can be customized.

**Key Properties:**

### `TmORMotHMAC` üõ°Ô∏è
Computes Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). This component provides a mechanism to verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. HMAC uses a cryptographic hash function and a secret key, ensuring that any alteration to the data or the use of an incorrect key will result in a different HMAC value. It supports various underlying hash algorithms and can process messages from text, raw data, files, or streams.

**Key Properties:**

- `OnError`: Fired when an error occurs.

### `TmORMotPBKDF2` üí™
Performs Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2. This component is crucial for securely storing user passwords. Instead of storing passwords directly or even their simple hashes, PBKDF2 applies a chosen hash function repeatedly (iterations) to a password, combined with a unique salt. This process makes brute-force and rainbow table attacks computationally expensive, significantly enhancing password security. You can customize the number of iterations, salt length, and the derived key's length.

- `MinIterations`: (Read-only) - Recommended minimum iterations for the selected algorithm.
- `LastError`: (Read-only) - Stores the last error message.
- `LastDerivedKey`: (Read-only) - Stores the last derived key.
- `PerformanceMs`: (Read-only) - Performance in milliseconds for the last operation.
- `OutputEncoding`: (oeBase64, oeHexadecimal, oeLowerHex, oeUpperHex, oeRaw) - Format for the derived key output.

**Key Methods:**

- `GenerateRandomSalt(SaltLength: Integer): string;`
- `EstimateDerivationTime(Iterations: Integer): Cardinal;` - Estimates the time taken for a given number of iterations (for SHA256 only).

**Key Events:**
- `OnKeyDerivationComplete`: Fired after successful key derivation.
- `OnError`: Fired when an error occurs.

### `TmORMotRandom` üé≤

This component is essential for any cryptographic application requiring high-quality random numbers for keys, salts, Initialization Vectors (IVs), and other security-sensitive data. It can generate random bytes, passwords with customizable character sets, encryption keys, salts, UUIDs, and tokens. It also includes a utility to test the randomness quality of given data.

**Key Properties:**

### Step 1: Download the Components ‚òÅÔ∏è
Download the components from this repository.

### Step 2: Install in Delphi IDE üíª
1. Open the `mORMot2Components.dproj` (or similar project file if renamed) in Delphi.
2. Right-click on the project in the Project Manager and select `Install`. This will install the components onto your Delphi IDE palette under 'mORMot2 Crypto'.

### Step 3: Add to Library Path üìÇ
Ensure the component source directory is in your Delphi library path to enable successful compilation of projects using these components:
1. Go to **Tools** ‚Üí **Options** in Delphi.
2. In the search bar at the top right, type "library path" and select the relevant option.
3. Add the output directory (e.g., `Win32\Release` or `Win64\Release` depending on your build configuration) of your compiled components to the **Library path**.

**Important Note on Path Conflicts**: If you have existing mORMot2 library paths configured, you might encounter unit conflicts or issues with IntelliSense. It is recommended to manage your library paths carefully to avoid such conflicts. Sometimes, temporarily removing conflicting mORMot2 paths during component installation and then re-adding them after installation can help.
